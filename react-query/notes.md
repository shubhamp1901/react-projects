- `cacheTime` determines for how long a certain response is supposed to stay in cache before it gets garbage collected.
- `staleTime` determines for how long a certain response will still be considered fresh (or not stale), dismissing the need for a new request
- `cacheTime` relates to the expiration of a specific value, while `staleTime` will be expiring the validity of a certain query
- React Query comes out of the box with a `cacheTime` of 5 minutes and a `staleTime` set to zero.
- It means that, by default, React Query will always cache your request responses for up to 5 minutes after they've been done. The advantage is that, when the user tries to fetch from the back-end a second time, React Query will serve the last value almost instantly.
- However, as our default for `staleTime` is set to zero, React Query will consider our request as stale (or not fresh) and trigger the second call in the background. And, once the call is finished, it will update our state with the freshly new data coming from the back-end.
- The advantage of using this strategy is the responsiveness provided to our users. We first optimistically provide them with the values we already have stored from previous requests. Then, in the background, we'll fetch the new data and update the UI if needed

  Most of the time, of course, we expect the data to not have changed. So the second query that is happening in the background could have been avoided. How can we do that? That where `staleTime` comes in handy! Let's see.

### **What happens when we increase the staleTime?**

* `staleTime` of 1 minute
* `cacheTime` of 5 minutes

Now let's go through a detailed timeline:

* At 00:00:00 a user fetches, for instance, our index of posts. At this moment, the response returned by our back-end will be stored by React Query and set to expire in 5 minutes. The query, on the other hand, will be considered to stay fresh for the next 1 minute.
* At 00:00:30 the same user interacts with the interface, triggering a new query to posts. As our cache is still valid, we'll serve it to the user. Secondly, as the query is still fresh, we'll NOT trigger a background call to update it.
* Four minutes later, at 00:04:30, the same user triggers the same call. As our cache is still valid, we will again serve it to the user. Secondly, as the query is now considered stale, React Query will have to trigger a background call. Once the response is returned, React Query will update the data provided to the user, and store the new value on the cache for the next 5 minutes.



Q-1: Will the cached data be reused in the component? Yes, if `cacheTime` preserves the data from garbage collection and allows it to be reused.

Q-2: Will an HTTP request to refresh the data be triggered? Yes, but only if `staleTime` determines that the query is NOT fresh any longer. In this case, a new HTTP request will be sent to refresh the data. It will happen in the background.

In this case, my opinionated (and quite pragmatic) (and sometimes polemic) recommendation would be to increase your `staleTime` to a very short duration, such as 20 seconds, while keeping your `cacheTime` at a higher level, say 5 minutes, or Infinite if you wish, that shouldn't make much of a difference anyway.

This specific setup should allow you to substantially reduce the number of successive calls triggered by sequential mounts and unmounts of components. At the same time, it prevents developers from having to hunt down every single edge case where cache invalidation is needed.
